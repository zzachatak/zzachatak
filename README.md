I am a student that is currently studying Cyber Security. I am looking forward for an opportunity to start my career in Cyber secruity/IT. Within my program I have learned a deep understanding of Cisco Networking and OS Fundmentals. Key secruity princples have been a huge focus for my degree, understanding the CIA tri and security best practices. I was taught Active directory and Virtual machines with Vmware and in the cloud with Azure.  I was able to have opportunities that allowed for project management and communicating with team members. 

## Objective


My journey in cyber security has led me to develop a passion for offensive security, I often find a large amount of curiosity in finding vulnerabilities and finding solutions to fix them. Long term I am looking to pursue an offensive secruity role and become a Pentester. I have been able to experiment with Home labs in order to replicate common attack vectors that are seen in the field.
